# A-Peculiar-Sentiment-Analysis-Advancement-in-Big-Data

## Abstract
Every company wants to discover what its customers feel about it. But sentiment analysis can get coarser and turn inward to improve employee as well as customers' satisfaction. A term called sentiment analysis, or the mathematical taxonomy of statements' negative or positive connotations, gives companies potent ways to analyse cumulative language data across all sorts of communications. There's real value in measuring sentiment inside and outside your company. Our big data experts analyse the core grounds of the problems raised while handling giant datasets and find solutions to efficiently manage massive datasets with ease. We built a sentiment analysis solution to measure positive and negative sentiments with top rating products for Amazon.com's Electronics products as against competitor products.
